title: Building a Supplier Compliance Platform in 18 Weeks
date: 2025-01-12
excerpt: Designing RESTful APIs, data models, and reporting that cut manual operations by ~70%.
---

**Context.** New EU regulations required traceable supplier data across 25k+ vendors. Our ops team relied on spreadsheets and manual emails.

**Approach.** We designed domain models, built Spring Boot services (upload, inline edit, delete), and centralized records in PostgreSQL + S3. Reporting exposed realâ€‘time compliance status.

**Outcome.** MVP in 18 weeks, ~70% manual reduction, and smoother client integrations.
